Features

Build
- Automated build system using Travis. Submission will compile code on Linux and send email on failure.
- Automated project file generation using premake by analysing directories.
- Scons as the build tool for compiling cross platform.

External libraries
- Played around with assimp, callback, DevIL, glsw as I wanted to.
- stbi for image loading. tiny_obj_loader for obj parsing. MemTrack for leak checks.
- tiny_obj_loader was wrapped so it converts the data into faster binary readable data on first run.

Renderer
- Works on Linux and Mac OS using OpenGL. DirectX not implemented.
- Design based on WildMagic5 which is an opensource engine.
- Really rough cut and a bit hacky in places.
- Focus was not optimization but instead learning the whole pipeline and problems.

Performance improvements
- Frustum culling would be obvious
- OctTree based scenegraph or external SceneGraphs
- Rendering proxies and material management systems

Other Projects
- Sequential which is this comic reading tool for Mac OS.

Minor bug fixes for
- tiny_obj_loader trim new line bugs in obj parser fixes
- Valve Source Engine Mac build issues
