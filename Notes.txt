Features

Build
- Automated build system using Travis.
- Scons as the build tool for compiling cross platform.
- Automated project file generation using premake by analysing directories.

External libraries
- Played around with callback, DevIL, glsw.
- stbi for image loading. tiny_obj_loader for obj parsing. MemTrack for leak checks.
- tiny_obj_loader was wrapped so it converts the data into faster binary readable data on first run.

Renderer
- Works on Linux and Mac OS using OpenGL.
- Really rough cut and a bit hacky in places.
- Focus was not optimization but learning pipeline and problems.

Performance improvements
- Frustum culling would be obvious.
- Octree based scenegraph or external SceneGraphs.
- Rendering proxies and material management systems.
